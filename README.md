# Learning Uni Maths
This is intended as a store of all the non-Olympiad maths I know, in a single place.
I have separated the definitions and theorems from the proofs, since I believe
in the value of proving the key theorems oneself, especially if one is aiming to
become a research mathematician.
Although this could be used to teach yourself higher maths, it
should be supplemented with applications and exercises that show the value of
the theory here developed.
I will also include my own (assuming I wasn't
spoiled and didn't give up) proofs for each theorem, mainly to ensure I can
actually prove them, and therefore that I actually understand the content.
