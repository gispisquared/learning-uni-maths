# Learning Uni Maths
This is intended as a store of all the non-Olympiad maths I know, in a single place.
For the subjects I've already learned, this book is broadly how I wish I'd
learned them: definitions and theorems without proof, so that you can go through
and prove everything in order. I will also include my own (assuming I wasn't
spoiled and didn't give up) proofs for each theorem, mainly to ensure I can
actually prove them, and therefore that I actually understand the content.
