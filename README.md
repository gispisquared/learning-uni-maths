# Learning Uni Maths
This is intended as a store of all the non-Olympiad maths I know, in a single place.
I have separated the definitions and theorems from the proofs, since I believe
in the value of proving the key theorems oneself, especially if one is aiming to
become a research mathematician.

Although this could be used to teach yourself higher maths, it
should be supplemented with applications and exercises that show the value of
the theory developed here. At the end of each section I have included a list of
references that the Internet generally considers standard or high-quality,
generally in order of increasing mathematical sophistication.

A note on analysis and calculus: I jump to analysis and calculus
over normed vector spaces immediately. This is for the sake of a
more efficient presentation, but not how one should learn the subject.
High-quality sources for real analysis and single-variable calculus include
- Burkhill, *A First Course in Mathematical Analysis*
- Hardy, *A Course in Pure Mathematics*
- Spivak, *Calculus*.
