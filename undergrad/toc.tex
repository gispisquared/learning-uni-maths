\begin{defn}
  A \emph{deterministic finite automaton (DFA)} is a $5$-tuple 
  \[(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F),\] where $Q$
  is a finite set called the \emph{states}, $\Sigma$ is a finite set called the
  \emph{alphabet}, $\delta:Q\times\Sigma\to Q$ is the \emph{transition
  function}, $q_0\in Q$ is the \emph{start state}, and $F\subseteq Q$ is the
  set of \emph{accept states}.
  We say that machine $M$ \emph{accepts} string $s=s_0s_1\cdots s_n$ if
  $\delta(\delta(\cdots\delta(\delta(q_0,s_0),s_1)\cdots,s_{n-1}),s_n)$ is an
  accept state.
  The set $A$ of all strings that machine $M$ accepts is the \emph{language of
  machine $M$}, notated $L(M)$. We also say that $M$ \emph{recognises} $A$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
  A language is a \emph{regular language} if it is recognised by some finite
  automaton.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
  Let $A$ and $B$ be languages. We define the \emph{regular operations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Union}: $A\cup B=\{x:x\in A\vee x\in B\}$.
    \item \emph{Concatenation}: $A\circ B=\{xy:x\in A\wedge y\in B\}$.
    \item \emph{Star}: $A^*=\{x_1x_2\cdots x_k: k\ge 0\wedge \forall i,\ x_i\in
      A\}$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
  The \emph{empty string} is notated $\varepsilon$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
  Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet. An \emph{atomic regular expression} is one of
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $a$ ($a\in\Sigma$),
    \item $\varepsilon$, and
    \item $\emptyset$.
  \end{itemize}

  \emph{Regular expressions} are obtained by combining simpler regular
  expressions with the operations $\cup,\ \circ,\ {}^*$.

  A regular expression $R$ \emph{describes} a language $L(R)$ obtained by
  replacing each instance
  of $a$ and $\varepsilon$ with $\{a\}$ and $\{\varepsilon\}$, respectively, and
  then applying the regular operations. 
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
  A language is regular iff some regular expression describes it.
\end{thm}
\begin{prop}[Pumping Lemma]
  If $A$ is a regular language, then there is a positive integer $p$ such that
  if $s$ is any string in $A$ of length at least $p$, then $s$ may be divided
  into three pieces, $s=xyz$, where $y$ is nonempty, $|xy|\le p$ and $x\circ
  y^*\circ z\subseteq A$.
\end{prop}
